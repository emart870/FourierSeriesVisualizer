# FourierSeriesVisualizer

Using a series of epicirlces, this code allows for one to visualize various fourier coefficients

In the "FourierCoef", there are different methods that return different fourier coefficients.
Currently, this code can visulize a square wave, a sawtooth wave, and a triangle wave.
