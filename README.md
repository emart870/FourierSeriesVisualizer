# FourierSeriesVisualizer

Using a series of epicirlces, this code allows for one to visualize various fourier coefficients

In the "FourierCoef" class, there are different methods that return different fourier coefficients. By calling different methods, different waves will be produced.

Currently, this code can visulize a square wave, a sawtooth wave, and a triangle wave.
